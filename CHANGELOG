30/09/2005 - 2.72

   - Harm Schotanus donated platform/Linux/sm_mem.c that works on 2.4/2.6
     linux kernels

   - platform/OpenBSD/sm_if.c no longer uses netns (Mitja Muzenic)

   - symux/share.c now uses a ringbuffer to distribute symon packets to
     connected tcp clients. Clients that can not keep up with the datarate are
     still killed, but have a bit more time to catch up.

   - Ulrich Spörlein updated proc probe for FreeBSD-current.

   - sm_mem for FreeBSD did not clear swap stats between calls (J. Martin
     Petersen)

19/03/2005 - 2.71

   - Ulrich Spörlein updated mem probe for FreeBSD-current and removed some
     bugs from FreeBSD/conf.sh.

   - J. Martin Petersen contributed the FreeBSD io probe and a new probe called
     pfq that can monitor pf altq queues on Free and OpenBSD.

22/02/2005 - 2.70

   - Ulrich Spörlein updated the FreeBSD proc and mem probes, found a bug in
     the mem probe for OpenBSD and helped extend the shell config files for
     FreeBSD.

   - Linux/Makefile.inc TSORT should be cat not echo

16/02/2005 - 2.69

   - inet6 support works again (Eric from Catastrophe.net)

14/01/2005 - 2.68

   - NetBSD/sm_debug.c now has proper sysctl mib values

   - if and pf probes for FreeBSD 5.3 (Fredrik Söderblom)

   - mbuf interface change for FreeBSD 5.3 (Stefan T. Peters)

   - Spelling errors in INSTALL/symon.8/symux.8 (Jan Sepp)

   - platform/*BSD/sm_proc transferred cpucpt as uint16 instead of double
     (Jamie Herre)

   - states_entries is a GAUGE, not a ABSOLUTE (Lars Hansson, Marco Pfatschbacher)

   - NetBSD/plaform.h -> platform.h (Joel Andersson)

   - tsort and lorder are not needed on Linux. (Mark Enzinas)

09/08/2004 - 2.67

   - Matthew Gream contributed the port and probes to NetBSD and FreeBSD.
     Probes for FreeBSD: cpu, debug, mbuf, mem and proc.  Probes for NetBSD:
     cpu, debug, if, io, mbuf, proc and sensor.

   - Added initial support for Linux: cpu and if.

   - Textual: INSTALL (Hiddo Hut)

   - Removed net_iso from symon.c (Hans Kremers)

   - Time since last update gets checked in symon.c to ensure correct
     operation with ntp

05/06/2004 - 2.66

   - arguments in network streams are now bound to 15 characters. symon
     will use more characters if specified in monitoring, but will only
     send the first 15 over the network. (Michael)

   - Textual: symux.8 and c_smrrds.sh agree on stream names.
     (Okan Demirmen)

29/02/2004 - 2.65

   - removed erroneous strlen in lex.c (Daniel Hartmeier)

   - added better socket error reporting (Daniel Polak)

27/02/2004 - 2.64

   - Added new disk structure. symon has a single notion of "io" - the
     new or the old depending on the machine it was built on. symux
     deals with legacy streams and knows about "io1" (upto 3.4)
     and "io" (3.5+). symux will accept legacy symons.

   - c_smrrds.sh complains if files cannot be built. (Daniel Polak)

   - symon no longer attempts reloading the configuration file when
     privsep.

   - Textual: INSTALL (Jan Sipke van der Veen), error texts in code
     (Stephen Tesch)

20/12/2003 - 2.63

   - removed large char arrays on the stack that broke name resolution

   - symon(8) now chroots and drop priviledges to user "_symon" (Henning
     Brauer)

   - added support for adjusting symon(8) monitoring interval (Henning
     Brauer)

   - removed typos and better starter configuration (Franciszek Holop)

   - port: MESSAGEs were incorrect (Soeren Thing Andersen), PLIST
     incomplete (Henning Brauer), HOMEPAGE in Makefile was off (Robert
     Winder)

12/10/2003 - 2.62

   - removed errors in c_smrrds.sh (Henning Brauer)

   - detecting sensor support was broken (Nick Forbes)

03/10/2003 - 2.61

   - added sensor probe

   - removed symon2web from base source package. symon2web (or the new
     syweb package) can be downloaded from the main website.

   - symux churnbuffer calculation now deals with ipv6 hostnames too

   - symux now allows file-less streams to be accepted

   - removed bug in display of incoming client connections on symux

   - symon uses group probes only for configured streams

   - c_config.sh was not included in the PLIST for the symon package
     (Andrew Dalgleish)

23/03/2003 - 2.60

   - sm_io was broken on sparc64
   - ntohq functions were not detected for big endian machines
   - c_config.sh broke on nfs mounts and pfsync

   All: thanks to Henning Brauer

26/02/2003 - 2.59

   - mbuf probe (Daniel Hartmeier; depends on 3.2)
   - example configuration is now installed in to symon/examples +
     better conflicts in port's PLIST (Christian Weisgerber)

24/01/2003 - 2.58

   Gustavo Chamone helped find a rare bug in symon/sm_io.c. strsep()
   would clobber stream information and make the first stream in the
   configuration file disappear.

   Daniel Hartmeier patched symon/sm_pf.c to deal with changes pf. His
   patch should also work for previous versions of pf.

10/01/2003 - 2.57

   Christian Weisgerber reported that netinet/ip_ipsp.h already defines
   htonq - fixed. Will Wainwright reported 1) a small bug in
   test_config.php - fixed, 2) that I left out some files
   (class_proc.inc and class_debug.inc) from the PLIST files.

29/12/2002 - 2.56

   Added proc and debug symon2web frontends. Debug has limited
   useability, you are better off defining one for yourself.

14/12/2002 -

   Added the proc module. This can be used to retrieve accumulated
   information about processes with the same name. A proc(httpd)
   statement in symon.conf, for instance, will result in the reporting
   of the number of processes called "httpd" and the amounts of cpu and
   memory that they take.

   Added em device to c_smrrds.sh - thanks to Jung.  Fixed typo in
   SymuxClient.pm - thanks Tobias Gresch.  c_config.sh did not deal with
   type mfs devices - thanks Dom De Vitto.

29/11/2002 - 2.55

   Markus Friedl reported that unresolvable ip addresses cannot be used
   in the configuration file - fixed.

   Overhauled the networking code. Everything is now ip6 aware. This
   does mean that the ':' is no longer a keyword in the lexer;
   i.e. 'host:port' statements should now be written as 'host
   port' or 'host "port" port'.

   Added the debug module. This can be used to retrieve debug0
   ... debug19 variables from the kernel.

08/11/2002 - 2.54

   Added a perl module that allows ppl to connect to symux and do
   something with the measurements as they come in. (I plan to drive an
   LCD using this, but it could also be used to get, say, daily
   bandwidth usage)

   Clients of symux would not sleep after they had read and relayed data
   symux gave to them. This could lead to one child eating up multiple
   'semaphore slots' and starvation in other clients - fixed.

25/10/2002 - 2.53

   Henning Brauer suggested a datadir statement for symux configuration
   - added.

   Henning also reported that c_smrrds.sh cannot create vlan10 and
   up. c_smrrds.sh now has a special case for pseudo-interfaces (bridge,
   enc, faith, gif, ppp, sppp, strip, tun, vlan)

   Nick Nauwelaerts helped improve dependency definitions in the port
   Makefile.

18/10/2002 - 2.52

   Julien Touche reported that symon/symux do not report initial cfg
   errors on the commandline - fixed.

   Reinhard Sammer, Julien and Henning Brauer all noticed that the php
   code needed globals - fixed. Passing by reference at call time
   resulted in php warnings - fixed.

   Henning thought it was nice to see a single machine at a time. Julien
   wanted clickable magnification for individual graphs. Both options
   can now be configured in datasources.inc.

   Resolved a bug reported by Vincent Kessler (who also provided the fix
   - cheers mate) in the rrdupdate call in symux - optind needs to be
   cleared ahead of the getopt call in rrdupdate.

   The Makefile.inc no longer overwrites CFLAGS. Configuration
   directories are now taken from the environment as expected by the
   openbsd ports system. (Thanks to Nick Nauwelaerts for pointing this
   out)

   Installation of symon now also generates a default symon.conf file if
   the system does not already have one.

   Someone at www.deadly.org pointed out that symon is no longer
   compatible with OpenBSD 3.0 - removed claim from the website.

   Added -f file switch to symon.

   The lexer started parsing from character position 1 instead of 0.

   symux would bomb out after a hup - fixed.

14/09/2002 - 2.51

   Steve Shockley reported that the port Makefile did not install rrd
   tool. (Which is required for compilation of symux)

13/09/2002 - 2.5 - kvm gone, renamed mon to symon

   Rewrote io.c to obtain information via sysctl only. All kvm code is
   now gone.

   Renamed mon to symon, monmux to symux and mon2web to symon2web. I
   liked mon better, but that name is already taken.

   Cleaned up webpages to be XHTML 1.0.

10/09/2002 - 2.4

   Added some example pf graphs. This data is hard to plot, ideas are
   welcome. Added better port support.

09/09/2002 - Towards a better port makefile

   Reworked port Makefile. It now generates a number of packages that
   can be used to just install mon, monmux or mon2web. The KVM stuff has
   become a special flavor of the monitor package.

06/09/2002 - Cosmetics again

   monmux/c_monrrds.sh:
     - Added RRD_ARGS support. All created rrds have
       start=epoch. Incoming data from hosts may be from an earlier time
       than rrd creation now.

   mon2web/class_[io|if|mem|cpu].inc, index.php:
     - Rewrote argument representation of the graphs to be the same as
       how it is configured in the configuration files.

   mon2web/class_pf.inc, graph_pf.php:
     - Initial pf support.

01/09/2002 - Internal cosmetics - not released

   mon/mon.c:
     - mon packetsize is still limited by size of struct monpacket in
       data.h:79. All other limits have been removed.

   lib/data.c mon/monnet.c monmux/muxnet.c:
     - header structure is now safely transported across the network.

   lib/data.c
     - added streamtypes b(yte) and s(hort) in preparation for new
       streams.

31/08/2002 - 2.3

    Makefiles, mon/mon.c:
     - Environment variable KVM will enable the building of a setgid
       kmem version of the monitor. If this environment variable is not
       present, a non priviledged monitor will be built. (Note that all
       kvm dependant modules will fail during operation)

       After today's changes, only the io probe needs kvm.

    mon/if.c:
     - obtain ifdata as per h1kari's suggestion.

    mon/pf.c:
     - global naming in sync with other probes
     - repeated initialisation would eat up fds

    Jan Sipke van der Veen
     - version number inconcistencies (main pkg/syslog)

    Daniel Hartmeier
     - shmat usage in monmux/share.c != 64 bit safe
     - some cpp macros missed precendence parenthesis


29/08/2002 - 2.2

    Merged contributions by Daniel Hartmeier:
     - cpu probe had a nasty va_arg bug that only showed up on
       big-endian machines.

29/08/2002 - 2.1

    Merged contributions by Daniel Hartmeier:
     - pf probe
     - changes to make mon compile on macppc and sparc64

28/08/2002 - released 2.0

    monitoring behaviour (mon) separated from storage/forwarding
    (monmux) and picture display (mon2web). Only mon has to run with
    kmem priviledges because of the if and io probes. Although the
    entire package was built with portability to other OpenBSD
    architectures in mind, it was never tested.

==== unreleased ====

25/07/2002 - rewrite stringptr functions in monmux to snprintf ones
           - package it for openbsd
           - added a crc32 algorithm in netmon and netmux
           - added DEBUG handling in Makefiles
           - removed a bug in monmux that made it reprocess already processed data.

22/06/2002 - added shared code, upgraded networking code

04/04/2002 - changed mon/monmux.conf format
	     written manual pages
             look at mon/cpu.c/percentages, give appropriate people credits.

01/04/2002 - changed all memsets into bzero
             all output messages have the same format now
             write pids in /var/run
             SIGHUP = reload configuration

31/03/2002 - cleaned up source

             added error reporting routines.

29/03/2002 - mon and monmux no use monpacket to communicate with each
             other. This format defines: version, lenght and crc of the traffic
             exchanged.

             mon no longer connects. monmux and mon can be started and stopped
             independently.

             monmux now checks if incoming traffic is allowed from a certain host.

             added rrd write support to monmux

             made c_monrrds.sh determine what files to build from environment

             got mon2web up to date with mon1. changed interface layout to
             have output as a negative area - i'm not finished with this.

22/03/2002 - Added get/set preamble, still tinkering with those s(u)(n)pack
             functions. Added one that translates it into text.

06/01/2002 - Removed init and get functions from the monlib. (init functions
             were also required in non-mon applications, not like it is
             supposed to be :)

             Next step is to rewrite the get functions into using the pack
             function.

05/01/2002 - Wrote spack and sunpack; endianess agnostic values to bytestream
             (and back) functions. The packet format has almost been defined
             now.

24/11/2001 - Rewrote lib to KNF, OpCodes removed
03/11/2001 - Added datatypes and rewrote readconf to use SLISTs.
01/10/2001 - Mon configuration is read from a mon.conf.
29/09/2001 - Lexer had trouble dealing with ip-addresses. Cleaned up the number
             parsing code and removed a second comment reader.
