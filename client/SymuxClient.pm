=head1 NAME

SymuxClient - Object client interface for symux

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use SymuxClient;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<SymuxClient> provides an object client interface for listening to, and
parsing of, symux data.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item new ( ARGS )

Creates a new C<SymuxClient> object that holds both the connection to a symux
and data it receives from that connection. Arguments are:

    host           dotted quad ipv4 hostaddress
    port           tcp port that symux is on
    retry*         maximum number of retries; used to limit number
		   of connection attempts and number of successive
		   read attempts

Arguments marked with * are optional.

Example:
    $sc = new SymuxClient(host => '127.0.0.1',
			  port => 2100);

=back

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item getitem (host, stream, item)

=back

Refresh the measured data and get an item from a stream for a particular
host. Note that successive calls for this function deal with successive
measurements of B<symon>. Set C<host> to '*' if data about any host is of
interest. Any errors are sent out on STDOUT prepended with 'error: '.

=over 4

=item getcacheditem (host, stream, item)

=back

Get an item from a stream for a particular host. Returns C<undef> if no data is
cached, or if the data cached does not match the B<host>. Can be called
multiple times to obtain items from the same measurement. Set C<host> to '*' if
data about any host is of interest. Any errors are sent out on STDOUT prepended
with 'error: '.

=over 4

=item getsource ()

=back

Get the symon source host of the currently cached information. Usefull to see
what host's data getcacheditem is working on.

Example:
    $sc = new SymuxClient(host => 127.0.0.1,
			  port => 2100);

    print $sc->getitem("127.0.0.1", "if(de0)",
		       "packets_out");

    # get more data from that measurement
    print $sc->getcacheditem("127.0.0.1","if(de0)",
			     "packets_in");

    # start a new measurement
    print $sc->getitem("*", "if(de0)",
		       "packets_out");
    # which hosts packets_out was that?
    print $sc->getsource();
