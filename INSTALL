Installation notes
==================

Real quick 
==========
make && make install && vi /etc/monmux.conf /etc/mon.conf && monmux && mon

Slightly less quick but with pretty pictures
============================================
- Install rrdtool. cd /usr/ports/net/rrdtool && make install should do the
  trick.

- Check Makefile.inc for settings. Things to watch out for are

     + PREFIX = Where does the installation tree start. Defaults to
                '/usr/local'.

     + BINDIR = Where should the daemons be put, relative to $PREFIX. Defaults
                to 'libexec'.

     + MANDIR = Where should the manuals be installed, relative to
                $PREFIX. Defaults to 'man'.

     + SHRDIR = Where are the example configurations to be installed. Defaults
                to 'share/mon'.

- Run make && make install

- Create an '/etc/mon.conf'. Note that there is an example configuration in
  $PREFIX/$SHRDIR. 

- Create a monmux.conf on the gatherer host. You can specify alternative
  locations than '/etc/monmux.conf' using 'monmux -f <monmux.conf>'.

- Create the rrd files where the incoming mon data is to be
  stored. $PREFIX/$SHRDIR/c_monrrds.sh is your friend. Note that 'mon2web'
  expects an '.../machine/*.rrd' style directory structure.

- Fire up mon, monmux. Check system logs for any failures.

- only if you need the webinterface: mon2web is not installed anywhere by
  default. Copy the files to a convenient apache directory and modify the
  mon2web/datasources.inc to reflect your filelocations. Note that it uses php,
  so you may need to (cd /usr/ports/www/php4; make install).

This package is an OpenBSD application. You can make monmux and mon2web run on
most POSIX compliant unixes, but the monitoring application itself (mon) is
OpenBSD specific.
