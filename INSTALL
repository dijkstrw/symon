Installation notes
==================

Real quick 
==========
make && make install && vi /etc/monmux.conf /etc/mon.conf && 
	~mon/monmux/c_monrrds.sh all && 
	/usr/local/libexec/monmux && 
	/usr/local/libexec/mon

Slightly less quick but with pretty pictures
============================================
- Install rrdtool. cd /usr/ports/net/rrdtool && make install should do the
  trick.

- Check Makefile.inc for settings. Things to watch out for are

     + PREFIX = Where does the installation tree start. Defaults to
                '/usr/local'.

     + BINDIR = Where should the daemons be put, relative to $PREFIX. Defaults
                to 'libexec'.

     + MANDIR = Where should the manuals be installed, relative to
                $PREFIX. Defaults to 'man'.

     + SHRDIR = Where are the example configurations to be installed. Defaults
                to 'share/mon'.

- Run make && make install

- Create an '/etc/mon.conf'. Note that there is an example configuration in
  $PREFIX/$SHRDIR. 

- Create a monmux.conf on the gatherer host. You can specify alternative
  locations than '/etc/monmux.conf' using 'monmux -f <monmux.conf>'.

- Create the rrd files where the incoming mon data is to be
  stored. $PREFIX/$SHRDIR/c_monrrds.sh is your friend. Note that 'mon2web'
  expects an '.../machine/*.rrd' style directory structure.

- Fire up mon, monmux. Check system logs for any failures.

- only if you need the webinterface: mon2web is not installed anywhere by
  default. Copy the files to a convenient apache directory and modify the
  mon2web/datasources.inc to reflect your filelocations. Note that it uses php,
  so you may need to (cd /usr/ports/www/php4; make install).

Installing mon on many machines
===============================

- Copy the mon-version.tar.gz to /usr/ports/distfiles/

- Use the ports directory to create a mon package. 
  cd ~mon/ports/mon
  make package
- The binary package can be found at 
  /usr/ports/packages/<arch>/All/mon-2.0.tgz

- You can transfer the resulting package to many machines and install it by
  pkg_add it.

This package is an OpenBSD application. You might be able to make monmux and
mon2web run on POSIX compliant unixes, but the monitoring application itself
(mon) is OpenBSD specific.
