Programming rules:

- Cpu cost matters more than storage. Network traffic is more expensive than
  cpu. 

- Structures are not overloaded in functionality even if that would be possible
  memberwise. Overloading = code can be understood in more than one way and
  that leads to more maintenance and bugs.

- Defined values are not overloaded in functionality if possible. Same reason
  as above.


== Problems Solved ==

- Generate a format for network traversal of data

	1) all data is big-endian
	2) streams are considered elements
