- Cpu cost matters more than storage. 

- Structures are not overloaded in functionality even if that would be possible
  memberwise. Overloading = code can be understood in more than one way and
  that leads to more maintenance and bugs.

- Defined values are not overloaded in functionality if possible. Same reason
  as above.

- Error messages carry __FILE__, __LINE__ if they are failed assertions and
  plain English if they can be attributed to the end-user.

- Marshalling is hard. Alignment is carried out by bcopy.
