Programming rules:

- Cpu cost matters more than storage.

- Structures are not overloaded in functionality even if that would be possible
  memberwise. Overloading = code can be understood in more than one way and
  leads to more maintenance and bugs.

- Defines are not overloaded in functionality if possible. Same reason as
  above.

== Problems to be solved ==

- Generate a format for network traversal of data

	1) all data is big-endian
	2) streams are considered elements
