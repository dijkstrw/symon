TODO:

== current problems / short term
   - symux queues rrd values for a particular time. Cheers to Jean-Gérard
     Pailloncy for the suggestion.

- rewrite sm_proc.c, don't count shared pages twice
- check shared memory for hackable bugs. (master should only write, clients
  should only read. clients should check incoming data for sanity.)

- check for availability of rrd before compilation
- make user/group part of makefile.inc

== longer term
- change rrd to accommodate batch updates
- write a muxer that supports unix pipes
- test framework
