Project Overview:

== current problems / short term
- add a fast crc algorithm in netmon and netmux
- allow other programs to connect to monmux for stream updates
- change rrd to accommodate batch updates
- make programs robust. failure => fatal now (by design :)
- mon2web should have graph objects/modules
  (ask a module what graphing options it supports and show these,
   the same module should also draw the picture, maybe php oo?)
- look at lib/net.c/lookup, rewrite it to not be joe's solution.
- add daemon syslog and verbose to error.[ch]
- bzero / memset 
- all errors should have the same format

== longer term
- write a muxer that supports unix pipes
- write a client that drives a crystal fontz lcd
- port to freebsd
- port to linux

== log 
31/03/2002 - cleaned up source

29/03/2002 - mon and monmux no use monpacket to communicate with each
             other. This format defines: version, lenght and crc of the traffic
             exchanged.

             mon no longer connects. monmux and mon can be started and stopped
             independently.

             monmux now checks if incoming traffic is allowed from a certain host.             

             added rrd write support to monmux

             made c_monrrds.sh determine what files to build from environment

             got mon2web up to date with mon1. changed interface layout to
             have output as a negative area - i'm not finished with this.

22/03/2002 - Added get/set preamble, still tinkering with those s(u)(n)pack
             functions. Added one that translates it into text.

06/01/2002 - Removed init and get functions from the monlib. (init functions
             were also required in non-mon applications, not like it is
             supposed to be :)

             Next step is to rewrite the get functions into using the pack
             function.

05/01/2002 - Wrote spack and sunpack; endianess agnostic values to bytestream
             (and back) functions. The packet format has almost been defined
             now.

24/11/2001 - Rewrote lib to KNF, OpCodes removed
03/11/2001 - Added datatypes and rewrote readconf to use SLISTs.
01/10/2001 - Mon configuration is read from a mon.conf. 
29/09/2001 - Lexer had trouble dealing with ip-addresses. Cleaned up the number	
             parsing code and removed a second comment reader.
