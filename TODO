TODO:

== current problems / short term
- rework sending struct
- rework port makefile, current version contains both (mon|monmux) on a host
  and that does not make sense for a probe only host.
- add pf graphs

== longer term
- change rrd to accommodate batch updates
- write a muxer that supports unix pipes
- write a client that drives a crystal fontz lcd
