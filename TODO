TODO:

== current problems / short term
- remove mon packet limit
- rework port makefile, current version contains both (mon|monmux) on a host
  and that does not make sense for a probe only host. flavors should be
  default, kvm, no-pf (3.1 and up dep)
- add pf graphs
- rework io to use sysctl
(- build sysctl to get disk structure)

== longer term
- change rrd to accommodate batch updates
- write a muxer that supports unix pipes
- write a client that drives a crystal fontz lcd
