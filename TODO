Project Overview:
== short term
- add rrd support to multiplexer
- change rrd to accommodate batch updates
- make programs robust. failure => fatal now (by design :)
- mon should not connect. This allows monmux and mon to be totally
  asynchronous. Mon will not send additional packets if monmux was killed
  during execution of mon.
- streams should include a crc
- clean up source
- monmux incoming source address computation fails

== longer term
- write a muxer that supports unix pipes
- write a client that drives a crystal fontz lcd
- port to freebsd
- port to linux

== current problems
- spack should be snpack
- Rewrite io/cpu/mem/if stream function storage
- Lexer does not deal correctly with "}<eof>" 
- Consolidate readconf(s) of mon and monmux.
- Define a packet format. Make mon spew the packet format. Make monmux grok the
  packet format.  
- Rewrite readconf monmux to deal with new data routines in lib/

== log 

22/03/2002 - Added get/set preamble, still tinkering with those s(u)(n)pack
             functions. Added one that translates it into text.

06/01/2002 - Removed init and get functions from the monlib. (init functions
             were also required in non-mon applications, not like it is
             supposed to be :)

             Next step is to rewrite the get functions into using the pack
             function.

05/01/2002 - Wrote spack and sunpack; endianess agnostic values to bytestream
             (and back) functions. The packet format has almost been defined
             now.

24/11/2001 - Rewrote lib to KNF, OpCodes removed
03/11/2001 - Added datatypes and rewrote readconf to use SLISTs.
01/10/2001 - Mon configuration is read from a mon.conf. 
29/09/2001 - Lexer had trouble dealing with ip-addresses. Cleaned up the number	
             parsing code and removed a second comment reader.
