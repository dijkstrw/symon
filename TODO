TODO:

== current problems / short term
- check that cpupct from proc is not broken. (got the feeling that %c handling
  might not be correct)
- rewrite sm_proc.c, don't count shared pages twice
- rewrite index.php, allow rrds in same dir as phps
- rewrite symon2web to allow use on internet websites
- allow editing of graphing parameters in symon2web
- add symon2web manual page / readme, explain weird format
- remove mon packet limit
- add mbuf usage, don't forget to add to PLISTs
- check shared memory for hackable bugs. (master should only write, clients
  should only read. clients should check incoming data for sanity.)
- symuxnet.c:get_symon_sockets looks weird. Check it out.
- churnbuffer assumes that ips are always 15 characters long (not true for ip6)

== longer term
- change rrd to accommodate batch updates
- write a muxer that supports unix pipes
- write a client that drives a crystal fontz lcd
