TODO:

== current problems / short term
- rewrite sm_proc.c, don't count shared pages twice
- remove mon packet limit
- check shared memory for hackable bugs. (master should only write, clients
  should only read. clients should check incoming data for sanity.)

== longer term
- change rrd to accommodate batch updates
- write a muxer that supports unix pipes
- test framework
