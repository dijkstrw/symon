Adding a new probe
------------------

Get your measurement as fast as possible with as little fuss as possible. Ideal
is to get all items that the user might want to query in one gets() and give
symon the readings for a particular item in a get().

Places to touch:

- lib/data.[ch]: define the new dataformat. MT_YOURSTREAM should be the old
  MT_EOF to not break old versions.

- lib/lex.[ch]: define the token for the lexer

- sym[on|ux]/readconf.c: parse the new token

- symux/c_smrrds.sh: add new rrdtool storage format

- platform/stub/sm_<name>.c: insert your stub probe here. Makefile will look
  for platform/<os>/sm_<name>.c after that.

- platform/<os>/sm_<name>.c: your probe

- symon/main.c: insert hooks into probe caller table

- symon/symon.8, symux/symux.8: add your token and its internal format to the
  manual pages.
