.Sh NAME
.Nm mon
.Nd system monitor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Op Fl vd
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a lightweight system monitor that measures cpu, memory, interface and disk statistics every 5 seconds. This information is then spooled to   
.Xr monmux 8
for further processing. 
.Pp
.Nm
has been designed to inflict minimal performance and security impact on the system it monitors. 
.Xr monmux 8
has performance impact proportional to the amount of streams it needs to manage. Ideally 
.Xr monmux should live on a different system and collect data from several 
.Nm
instances in a LAN. 

The options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show version information.
.It Fl d
Stop 
.Nm
from becoming a daemon and show debug information on stdout.

.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
obtains configuration data from 
.Ar /etc/mon.conf .
The configuration file contains monitor stanzas that define what resources should be monitored and to which 
.Xr monmux 8
the information should be streamed to.
.Pp
Multiple monitor statements to different muxes are allowed. Whitespace, newlines and text behind '#' are ignored. The format in BNF:
.Pp
.nf
monitor-rule = "monitor" "{" resources "}" "stream" ["to"] host [ port ]
resources    = resource ["(" argument ")"] [ ","|" " resources ]
resource     = "cpu" | "mem" | "if" | "io"
host         = ip4addr | hostname
port         = [ "port" | ":" | "," ] portnumber
argument     = number | interfacename | diskname
.fi
.Sh EXAMPLE
Here is an example 
.Ar mon.conf
that monitors cpu, memory, interfaces xl0/de0/lo0/wi0, disks wd[0-3]/cd[0-1] and streams that information to localhost on port 2100.
.Pp
.nf
monitor { cpu(0),  mem,     if(xl0), if(de0),
          if(lo0), if(wi0), io(wd0), io(wd1), 
          io(wd2), io(wd3), io(cd0), io(cd1), 
          io(ccd0)} stream to 127.0.0.1 2100
.fi
.Sh SIGNALS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It SIGHUP
Causes
.Nm
to read 
.Ar /etc/mon.conf .
.Nm
will keep the old configuration if errors occured during parsing of the configuration file.
.Sh BUGS
Every monitored resource mentioned 
.Ar /etc/mon.conf 
gets queried. Mentioning, for example, cpu(0) twice for different muxes will result in two distinct cpu(0) measurement actions. 
.Pp
.Nm 
does not check whether resources mentioned in 
.Ar /etc/mon.conf
exist.
